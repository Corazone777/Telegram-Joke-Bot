# Telegram-Joke-Bot
Minimal joke telegram bot
For now it sends joke only when program is started due to a lack of https domain (can't use webhook otherwise)

Config:
       $chat_id is id of the chat you want to send a joke, can be obtained with /getMe method 
       TELEGRAM_KEY is API key from your bot, you get it when new bot is created with BotFather
